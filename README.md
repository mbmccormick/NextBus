# nextbus

Access the CityBus MyRide system for real-time bus schedule information.


## Requirements

nextbus is a small web application that retreives real-time bus schedule information from the CityBus MyRide service and displays the results in a unique interface that resembles a departure board at a train station or airport.


## Installation

This service is designed to be run on a LAMP development platform. The scripts and configuration files cannot be run through a desktop environment. One cron job is also needed in order to keep the application running.

The website is accessible via desktop web browser, mobile phone, and as a Google Gadget.


## Usage

This application is self-sustaining, meaning that once the scripts and configuration files are loaded on a LAMP server, no additional maintenance or overhead is necessary.

nextbus is fully dependend upon the CityBus MyRide system. Occasional maintenance will cause nextbus to not display bus schedule information.
